## Need for creating a fork of this repo in Runscope
The latest version of this Repo has an open defect wherein we're getting the below error.

````
# github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/xml
../../github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/xml/document.go:330:19: identifier "_Ctype_struct__xmlDoc" may conflict with identifiers generated by cgo
````
To fix this issue, we had to fork it out in Runscope as the original owner is not merging an open PR 
https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/pull/97

If in future there are changes in the original repo, we may need to take a pull every time to sync it up 
with the original repo.
